## 2025-04-09 10:00

## 2025-04-09 11:30
- Defined project scope and implementation plan
- Created plan.md document outlining the semantic search system architecture
- Documented core components: preprocessing and search interface

- Updated dependency plan to use more built-in functionality:
  - Will use built-in fetch API instead of axios
  - Will use crypto.randomUUID() instead of uuid library
  - Will receive API key as parameter instead of using dotenv
  - Added glob library for file pattern matching

- Researched and compared glob vs fast-glob libraries
- Decided to use fast-glob for better performance and TypeScript compatibility
- Updated plan.md to reflect this change
